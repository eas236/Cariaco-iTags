## Next calcululate the ANOSIM statistics and use SIMPER analyses to look at between-group differences

# Caluculate Bray curtis dissimilarity matrix
bac_dis <- vegdist(AB_trans_trim) 

# ANOSIM
anosim(bac_dis,Size.Fraction) # output is anosim statistics on dissimilarities between size fraction groups
anosim(bac_dis,Season) # between season groups
anosim(bac_dis,OxCond) # between redox condition groups
# An r value close to "1.0"  suggests dissimilarity between groups while an R value close to "0" 
# suggests an even distribution of high and low ranks within and between groups. R values below "0" 
# suggest that dissimilarities are greater within groups than between groups. 

# SIMPER analyses - determines which OTUs are driving the dissimilarity
# First look between redox condition groups
simper_AB_OxCond <- simper(AB_trans_trim, OxCond, permutations = 0)
capture.output(simper_AB_OxCond, file = "StatResults/Simper_bac_full_OxCond.txt") # save results in a text file

# Now look between Size fraction groups
simper_AB_PAFL <- simper(AB_trans_trim, Size.Fraction, permutations = 0)
capture.output(simper_AB_PAFL, file = "StatResults/Simper_bac_full_PAFL.txt")

# Season not significant according to ANOSIM so don't need to check that with SIMPER
